# HreLanguage

Hrê is a North Bahnaric language of central Vietnam. Hrê is used in Quang Ngai province, Vietnam. The Hre Language is not so popular hence there is no strong dictionary to popularise it. Joining a travel project, I can approach to this language in order to enhance tourism in this area

Gathering data from hand-writing images datasets, which are quite difficult to collect automatically, a seq2seq approach is used to work with sentence-to-sentence type. About 250 of vocabulary size of both input language and output language, the idea of LSTM is used to handle this small dataset. 

With just 4.0 val_loss as the result, it is hoped that a bigger dataset can help the model to perform better. Currently, using deep learning for NLP is still popular and it is dominant around the world

Thanks to my teacher Hoang Son of USTH for let me join the project
Thanks to sil.org where I could get the handwriting datasets
Thanks to text scanner for scanning Hre and Vietnamese words
Special thanks to my girlfriend who helped me do the blue collar work (white collar according to her) such as re-writing correct rows
